0,2335273,Interaction of GABA and volatile anesthetics in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.,"['The authors tested whether mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans with altered sensitivity to volatile anesthetics have altered responses to GABA or GABA-agonists. They determined the ED50s of the wild-type strain N2 and two mutant strains of C. elegans to a GABA-mimetic ivermectin (IVM) and to GABA. unc-79, a strain with increased sensitivity to halothane, was more sensitive than N2 to IVM and GABA. unc-9, a strain that suppresses the increased sensitivity of unc-79 to halothane, was less sensitive than N2 to IVM and GABA. The authors also tested whether doses of GABA or IVM and volatile anesthetics were additive in their effects on C. elegans. Halothane (2.1%) did not shift the ED50 of IVM, but was antagonistic to GABA. Enflurane (4%) was antagonistic to both IVM and GABA.

Differences in the accumulation of IVM and MOX in the brain and in the interaction of IVM and MOX with GABA(A) receptors account for differences in neurotoxicity seen in intact and Mdr1-deficient animals. These differences in neurotoxicity of IVM and MOX are important in considering their use in humans.']",0.5373015873015873,"[In rat α1β2γ2 GABA channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, IVM and MOX were both allosteric activators of the GABA-induced response., In rat α1β2γ2 GABA channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, IVM and MOX were both allosteric activators of the GABA-induced response., The Hill coefficient was 1.52±0.45 for IVM and 0.34±0.56 for MOX (p<0.001), while the maximum potentiation caused by IVM and MOX relative to GABA alone was 413.7±66.1 and 257.4±40.6%, respectively (p<0.05), showing that IVM causes a greater potentiation of GABA action on this receptor., The Hill coefficient was 1.52±0.45 for IVM and 0.34±0.56 for MOX (p<0.001), while the maximum potentiation caused by IVM and MOX relative to GABA alone was 413.7±66.1 and 257.4±40.6%, respectively (p<0.05), showing that IVM causes a greater potentiation of GABA action on this receptor., The Hill coefficient was 1.52±0.45 for IVM and 0.34±0.56 for MOX (p<0.001), while the maximum potentiation caused by IVM and MOX relative to GABA alone was 413.7±66.1 and 257.4±40.6%, respectively (p<0.05), showing that IVM causes a greater potentiation of GABA action on this receptor.]"
13,2181052,Effects of starvation and neuroactive drugs on feeding in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"['Caenorhabditis elegans concentrates its food, bacteria, by pharyngeal pumping. The rate of pumping is affected by the presence of bacteria. Using a new assay that allows measurement of pumping rate in a population of worms suspended in liquid by measuring their uptake of microscopic iron particles, we have confirmed and quantitated this effect. Furthermore, we demonstrated that starvation stimulates pumping. Worms that had been deprived of bacteria for more than 4 hours pumped in the absence of bacteria under conditions in which well-fed worms did not. Furthermore, starved worms responded to lower amounts of bacteria than did fed worms. The assay was also useful for measuring effects of drugs on pumping. Of about 30 chemicals screened, 5 had clear effects. The neurotransmitter serotonin and the serotonin uptake inhibitor imipramine stimulated pumping, while the serotonin antagonist gramine inhibits. Imipramine stimulation is greatly decreased in cat-1 and cat-4 mutants, which have low levels of serotonin. Muscimol, an agonist for the neurotransmitter GABA, and ivermectin, whose site of action may also be the GABA receptor, both inhibit pumping. Qualitative observations suggested a role for acetylcholine in the regulation of pumping.']",0.43333333333333335,"[Muscimol, an agonist for the neurotransmitter GABA, and ivermectin, whose site of action may also be the GABA receptor, both inhibit pumping., Muscimol, an agonist for the neurotransmitter GABA, and ivermectin, whose site of action may also be the GABA receptor, both inhibit pumping.]"
